# Platin

This is a quick port of my old Bacherlor porject for which i had written a operating system kernel.

At this point the project is 11 years old and does not reflect the full knowledg of C/C++ i have now.
But never the less, it should give a good overview how i think and tend to organize my source code.

Since this project was for my Bachelor Exam an extensive documentation exists which details the setup of project and why some design decision are done.
You will find none of this here, because typical i am not asked to put up 11 year old projects on Github, in my vaccation, so someone has a reference for my work.

Have fun and a nice day!
